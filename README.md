## Downloads

Release builds are published on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CyberSteve777/c-editor-flutter/releases). Beta builds are available as workflow artifacts in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/CyberSteve777/c-editor-flutter/actions).

C-Editor can also be accessed from web:

- **Latest stable version available at:** [pvz2c-level-editor.vercel.app](https://pvz2c-level-editor.vercel.app/) (from `main`)

- **Preview available at:** [c-editor-git-dev-international2c.vercel.app](https://c-editor-git-dev-international2c.vercel.app/) — unstable, built from `dev`.

## Building from source

### Initial setup

1. Install the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (**≥ 3.41**, Dart ≥ 3.11).
2. Enable the platforms you need:
   - **Windows desktop:** `flutter config --enable-windows-desktop` — requires [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (or Build Tools) with the **Desktop development with C++** workload.
   - **Web:** `flutter config --enable-web`
   - **Android:** Android Studio with the Android SDK and a configured device/emulator.
3. Run `flutter doctor` and fix any blocking issues before building.
4. Clone this repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyberSteve777/c-editor-flutter.git
cd c-editor-flutter
flutter pub get
```

**Linux desktop** additionally needs: `cmake`, `clang`, `ninja-build`, `libgtk-3-dev`, `pkg-config`, `liblzma-dev`, `libstdc++-14-dev`.

On first launch (desktop and mobile), pick a writable **level library** folder. The web build stores levels in browser memory until you download them.

### Run (debug)

```bash
flutter run -d windows   # Windows
flutter run -d linux     # Linux
flutter run -d chrome    # Web
flutter run -d android   # Android
```

### Build (release)

```bash
flutter build windows --release
flutter build linux --release
flutter build apk --release
flutter build web --release
```
